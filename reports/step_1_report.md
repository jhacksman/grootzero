# Step 1: Project Setup & Detailed Plan

## Step Objective
The objective of this initial step was to establish the foundational project structure for the GROOTZERO project and develop a comprehensive multi-step project plan that will guide the subsequent development process. This includes setting up the basic directory structure, creating an informative README, and outlining a detailed roadmap for implementing the autonomous sim2real robotics pipeline.

## Implementation Details
In this step, the following was implemented:

1. **Basic Project Structure**: Created the following directory structure to organize the codebase:
   - `src/`: Core source code for the project
   - `sim_environments/`: Isaac Sim environment configurations and setup scripts
   - `controllers/`: Robot controller implementations
   - `tasks/`: Task definition scripts
   - `reports/`: Project progress reports
   - `docs/`: Documentation files

2. **Project README**: Developed a comprehensive README.md that provides an overview of the project, outlines the core components, and describes the project structure.

## Contribution to Overall Project
This initial setup provides the necessary foundation for organized development of the GROOTZERO project. The directory structure reflects the logical separation of concerns in the system, and the README offers a clear introduction to the project for new contributors. The detailed project plan outlined below will serve as a roadmap for systematic development of the project components.

## Challenges & Solutions
No significant technical challenges were encountered during this initial setup phase. However, planning a complex project that integrates multiple advanced technologies (Isaac Sim, GR00T N1, AZR concepts) requires careful consideration of component interactions and dependencies. The project plan addresses this by breaking down the development into logical, incremental steps with clear dependencies.

## Testing & Validation
The basic project structure has been validated by ensuring all required directories were created successfully. The README.md has been reviewed for clarity and completeness.

## Learnings/Knowledge Gaps
During this initial planning phase, several knowledge gaps were identified that will need to be addressed in subsequent steps:

1. **GR00T N1 API Access**: The current state and availability of the GR00T N1 SDK/API needs to be researched. A mock interface may need to be developed initially.

2. **Isaac Sim Integration Complexity**: The complexity of integrating with Isaac Sim's Python API needs to be assessed in more detail. This includes understanding the specific requirements for scene management, physics simulation, and sensor data access.

3. **Hardware Requirements**: The hardware requirements for running Isaac Sim and potentially GR00T N1 locally need to be determined. This includes understanding VRAM constraints (noted 64GB limit) and how they might affect the implementation.

4. **Fine-tuning Approach**: The specific approach for fine-tuning GR00T N1 based on simulation feedback needs to be researched and defined. This includes understanding the data format requirements and fine-tuning process.

5. **Domain Randomization Parameters**: The specific parameters that should be randomized in the simulation environment to facilitate effective sim2real transfer need to be identified and prioritized.

These knowledge gaps will be addressed through research and experimentation in the early implementation steps of the project.
